# "GAME"
![icon]("icon.png")

This game doesn't even have a name yet.
My first game built in [Godot Engine](http://godotengine.org/ "Godot Engine").  I'm using this project to learn GDScript language and game developing.
Functioning game can be found in [Releases](https://github.com/vuxnq/game/releases "Releases").
